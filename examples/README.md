# Examples

### TODO (steve docs) add examples of the following
- [x] single party execution with hydration
- [ ] complex single party execution and then update single party execution with proto indexer and with hydration
- [ ] multiple contract batching and sending to chain
- [ ] multi party execution
- [ ] multistep execution
- [ ] skipping execution and using client strictly to save objects and persist to provenance
- [x] once examples exist, make sure CI is building all examples to verify they stay up to date
