# Examples

### TODO (steve docs) add examples of the following
- single party execution
- multi party execution
- multistep execution
- single party execution with proto indexer usage
- update single party execution with hydration
- standalone hydration example
- skipping execution and using client strictly to save objects and persist to provenance
- once examples exist, make sure CI is building all examples to verify they stay up to date
